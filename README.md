# Learn Reagent

## Course files for [LearnReagent.com](https://www.learnreagent.com)

The code in this repo is split into two folders - `giggin` - starting point of the videos (this is what you should open when you start to code along with the vidoes) and - `increments` - code for the start of each video (if you get lost somewhere along the way just copy the content of the video you are starting and continue).

## Start

```
git clone git@github.com:jacekschae/learn-reagent-course-files.git

cd learn-reagent-course-files/giggin/
```
